      <p id="additional-info" class="hidden">Palak relocated from Indore to Mumbai in 2006 in order to pursue her career as a singer in Bollywood. She had a strong desire to be a playback singer since she was a child and had published six non-film records during her childhood and adolescence. She had previously released her first album, 'Child for Children,' through Tips Music, in 2001 when she was nine years old. Her second album, 'Palken,' was released in 2003, and she proceeded to release more of her songs in this manner, like 'Dil ke Liye' and 'Aao Tumhe Chand Per Le Jaaye'. In 2011, T-Series published her religious devotional song record 'Jai Jai Dev Ganesh.' Finally, she sang her first Bollywood song in the film 'Damadamm,' which was released in 2011 and earned a lot of great feedback. In the same year, she recorded her second song, 'Pyaar Ke Silsile,' for the film 'Na Jaane Kabse.' However, 
      both the film and the soundtrack garnered negative feedback.
      Muchhal knew Salman Khan, the Bollywood star whom she met in Mumbai. Khan had previously proposed her name to Sajid-Wajid, who were the music composers of his movie, Veer. He had also suggested her name to the Yash Raj Productions. The recommendation was followed by Muchhal collaborating with KK on the track "Laapata" for the Yash Raj label, which was featured in the 2012 hit film Ek Tha Tiger. Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif starred in the musical track. The song was a huge smash for the year, and through it, she got exposed to Hindi Music Industry.</p>
